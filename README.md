/* HINDSIGHT OVERVIEW / RESUME INFORMATION

Someone needs to go back in time and tell me to stop starting so many projects without finishing the 
old ones first... This one would have been pretty neat too. Don't think I ever really started it
unfortunately; Vaguely remember running into problems with the tcod library and python3, and shelving
it.
